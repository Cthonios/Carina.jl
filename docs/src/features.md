# Features

What Carina supports today. Items marked *planned* are design goals with no
current implementation — they are called out explicitly so the input reference
is not read as promising more than it delivers.

## Execution

- **Single source, three backends.** CPU, NVIDIA (CUDA), and AMD (ROCm)
  from one code base via
  [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl).
- **Vendor-free library.** The GPU packages live in the launcher environment,
  not in Carina itself, so the library installs and runs without CUDA or ROCm
  present.
- **CPU multithreading** of element assembly and constitutive evaluation.
- **Matrix-free explicit path.** Central difference opts the assembler into
  matrix-free mode, skipping sparse preallocation entirely — on a 530k-DOF mesh
  that is several GB of allocation avoided.

## Physics

- **Finite-deformation solid mechanics**, built on
  [ReferenceFiniteElements.jl](https://github.com/Cthonios/ReferenceFiniteElements.jl)
  and
  [FiniteElementContainers.jl](https://github.com/Cthonios/FiniteElementContainers.jl).
- **Material models** from
  [ConstitutiveModels.jl](https://github.com/Cthonios/ConstitutiveModels.jl):
  neo-Hookean, linear elastic, Hencky, Saint Venant–Kirchhoff, Seth–Hill,
  small-strain J2 plasticity, and finite-deformation J2 plasticity.
- *Planned:* heat conduction, multiphysics coupling, contact, and multidomain
  Schwarz coupling. Note that `model.type` is currently parsed but not
  dispatched on — solid mechanics is the only physics.
- *Not supported:* more than one material per mesh. Carina applies a single
  constitutive model and density to the whole domain; see
  [Materials](reference/materials.md).

## Time integration

| Scheme | Kind | Nonlinear solve |
|---|---|---|
| Quasi-static | Equilibrium, no inertia | Newton / NLCG / steepest descent |
| Newmark-β, HHT-α | Implicit dynamics | Newton / NLCG / steepest descent |
| Central difference | Explicit dynamics | none |

- **Adaptive time stepping** for the implicit schemes: shrink on solver
  failure, grow on success, within user bounds.
- **CFL-based stable step estimation** for explicit runs, computed from element
  characteristic length and the material wave speed, with optional periodic
  recomputation as the mesh deforms.
- **Output-interval subcycling.** The integrator takes as many internal steps as
  needed between output frames, landing exactly on output times.

## Solvers

**Nonlinear:** Newton–Raphson with Armijo line search (on by default),
nonlinear conjugate gradient, and preconditioned steepest descent. The latter
two are matrix-free.

**Linear:** sparse direct (LU), conjugate gradient, and L-BFGS.

**Preconditioners:**

| | CPU | GPU |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Jacobi | ✓ | ✓ |
| Chebyshev polynomial | ✓ | ✓ |
| Incomplete Cholesky (LDLᵀ) | ✓ | — |
| Smoothed-aggregation AMG | ✓ | — |

The AMG preconditioner uses the six rigid-body modes as its near-nullspace,
rebuilt from the **current** configuration at each hierarchy build, which keeps
CG iteration counts nearly independent of the time step. Its hierarchy setup is
lagged and reused. GPU AMG is *planned*; the GPU path currently relies on
Jacobi or Chebyshev.

**Composable termination criteria.** Convergence and failure are expressed as a
tree of status tests — residual, update, iteration count, divergence,
stagnation, and finiteness — combined with `any`/`all` logic. See
[Solvers](reference/solvers.md).

**Dirichlet conditions by DOF elimination**, never by penalty. The reduced
system carries no artificial conditioning, which matters directly for Krylov
convergence.

## Boundary and initial conditions

- **Dirichlet** on side sets or node sets, per component, as a function of
  space and time.
- **Neumann** as surface tractions on side sets, or point loads on node sets.
- **Body forces** per element block.
- **Initial conditions** for displacement and velocity.
- **Traveling-wave initial conditions**, where you supply the displacement
  profile, a propagation axis, and a signed wave speed, and Carina derives the
  consistent velocity field `v₀ = −c·∂u₀/∂s` by **symbolic differentiation** —
  no hand-written derivatives.
- **Expression language** over `x`, `y`, `z`, `t` with named bindings, compiled
  once to an allocation-free scalar function.

## Input and output

- **Exodus** mesh input and result output, readable by ParaView.
- **YAML-driven** setup — no recompilation to change a problem.
- **Selectable output fields:** displacement (always), velocity, acceleration,
  per-quadrature-point stress, deformation gradient, and constitutive state.
- **Nodal recovery** of element quantities by lumped or consistent (full L2)
  projection.
- **Input validation.** Every section is key-checked, with a Levenshtein-based
  "did you mean" suggestion on unknown keys. Values drawn from a fixed set
  (solver, integrator, preconditioner, quadrature, recovery) are rejected rather
  than defaulted, and every element block, node set, and side set named in the
  input is verified against the mesh before it is used. See
  [how input errors surface](reference/index.md#How-input-errors-surface).

## Scale

The explicit GPU path has been run to **7.8 M DOF** (2.5 M elements) on a
single 8 GB consumer GPU. Throughput is memory-bandwidth bound, and the
GPU-to-CPU advantage widens with problem size before plateauing at roughly 3×
on that hardware — approximately 80% of the memory-bandwidth ratio between the
two devices.
